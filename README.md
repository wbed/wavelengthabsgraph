This code produces a figure detailing the terrestrial spectra of the sun, comparing the area of the graph that antase, ag, and antase-ag can absorb.

Spectral data was sourced from NREL at http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ASTMG173/ASTMG173.xls

Anatase's band gap data was sourced from Z. U. Rehman et al., ‘Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Using TiO2-Based Photocatalysts and TiO2 Z-Scheme Heterojunction Composites: A Review’, Molecules, vol. 27, no. 7. MDPI AG, p. 2069, Mar. 23, 2022. doi: 10.3390/molecules27072069.

Ag NP's visible spectrum data was sourced from S. Singh, A. Bharti and V. K. Meena, “Green synthesis of multi-shaped silver nanoparticles: optical, morphological and antibacterial properties,” Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 3638-3648, 2015.
